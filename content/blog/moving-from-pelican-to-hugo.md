I was looking for a better theme for my blog which is based on
[Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) static site generator in Python, but then I happened to look at
[this](http://npf.io) blog written in Hugo - a Go counterpart of Pelican. The
thing which caught my eye was the [posts](http://npf.io/blog/) page, which is
exactly how I wanted my first page to be. I've always wanted something like
Paul Graham's [essays](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html) page, but couldn't
find anything close to it until I found this site. After some thought, I
decided to make the move. This move has no effect on my love for Python
language. It's just laziness trumping drudgery :)

The good thing about static site generators is all of them support markdown --
the markup language in which my Pelican blog was written. Althought the syntax
of Hugo was different, I could scribble up a [small Python
script](https://github.com/rushiagr/public/blob/master/scripts/pelican-to-hugo.py)
to convert Pelican's way of writing blog metadata to Hugo's.

Since I didn't want readers who saved my blog links as bookmarks to suffer, I
had to manually make sure that the URLs of blog posts are not changed. Hugo by
default uses the markdown file name as the URL name. Pelican by default
converts blog post title to a slug and uses that slug in the URL. This has
helped me have markdown file names in lexicographical order (first one named as
`a-my-first-blog.md`, second one `b-sequel-of-first-article.md`, and so
on) for chronological viewing. But now I have to either change the file names,
or write a `slug` entry to each blog post's metadata. I figured out the earlier one
would be less time consuming, and did just that.

One problem I faced was, the site-generation script was throwing an error.
Googling and stackoverflowing told me that it's due to Hugo version
incompatibility. When Nate Finch, the original author of
[npf.io](http://npf.io) generated his site, he must have used an older version
of Hugo. But I had only the latest Hugo binary, built from source. Within some
time I was able to figure out the problem and
[fixed](https://github.com/rushiagr/npf/commit/712506d460dbeb7cb80757d9d4f533f75983968d) them, and then submitted
[pull request](https://github.com/natefinch/npf/pull/5) for the same too. Open
source for the win :)

I also realized than whenever I create a new blog post using `hugo new
<filename>.md`, it would create another entry on the left sidebar, and not as a
blog post inside the 'posts' page. The workaround was easy here too: just move
the markdown file to `blog` directory, and change a few variables as I've now
written in [readme](https://github.com/rushiagr/npf#create-a-new-post), and
it works as expected. I should probably write a shell function to do all of
these steps in one go :)

I had to ensure that I remove all files generated by Pelican, as otherwise one
blog entry was going to the older-Pelican themed page when clicked on its link.
This and a
[few](https://github.com/rushiagr/npf/commit/384283276cd960e494f97df9de46fda2f7f58383)
tweaks later, I had my shiny blog ready :)
