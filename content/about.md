Hello, my name is Rushi Agrawal and I'm a software engineer by profession.
Currently I'm working in Bangalore as a consultant to a stealth-mode startup,
taking care of backend and ReSTful APIs of the startup. I was a software
development engineer at Reliance Jio Cloud, and NetApp before this stint.

Programming is something I've been passionate about since last 7 years. My
primary languages of development are Python and shell scripts. I dabble wih Go
too nowadays.

I graduated from IIT Hyderabad in 2012 with a Bachelors degree in Computer
Science and Engineering. Before that, I lived at and did my schooling from my
hometown Shegaon near Nagpur.

When not developing software, I watch and read about cricket, keep myself fit
by exercising or jogging, explore the country, or reading tech blogs.
I want to plant a lot of trees when I will get to stay at a house for more than
3 years at a stretch.
