I'm a developer at Reliance Jio, working on developing relational database
service just like Amazon RDS. I write code mostly in Python, with a little bit
of shell scripts in-between. I love open source, and distributed distributed systems.

When I'm
not at work, I'm again sitting mostly in front of a computer hacking on some
thing or the other, or reading random tech articles on the net. I follow a
little bit of Cricket too. I'm yet to find time to actually play cricket after
school days.
