Hello! I am Rushi Agrawal, a computer technology enthusiast and engineer.

I work as a software consultant and engineering lead at a startup. I have
brought two products of that startup to launch as a core engineer. In my
previous job, I was the primary contributor for developing relational database
service for their infrastructure cloud.

I created and contributed to a few open source projects too.

I have an interest in distributed systems, especially distributed databases.
Even though distributed databases find a wide range of application in today's
world, I still think that a vast majority of them can do pretty well with
existing relational databases like PostgreSQL.

I graduated from IIT Hyderabad in 2012 with a Bachelors degree in Computer
Science and Engineering. Before that, I did my schooling from my hometown
Shegaon near Nagpur.

When not thinking about software, I watch and read about cricket.

Thank you for your time.
